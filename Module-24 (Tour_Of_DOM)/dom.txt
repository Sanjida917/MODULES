The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.





# HTML collection vs NodeList

The Difference Between an HTMLCollection and a NodeList :

* A NodeList and an HTMLcollection is very much the same thing.

* Both are array-like collections (lists) of nodes (elements) extracted from a document. The nodes can be accessed by index numbers. The index starts at 0.

* Both have a length property that returns the number of elements in the list (collection).

* An HTMLCollection is a collection of document elements.

* A NodeList is a collection of document nodes (element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes).

* HTMLCollection items can be accessed by their name, id, or index number.

* NodeList items can only be accessed by their index number.

* An HTMLCollection is always a live collection. Example: If you add a <li> element to a list in the DOM, the list in the HTMLCollection will also change.

* A NodeList is most often a static collection. Example: If you add a <li> element to a list in the DOM, the list in NodeList will not change.

* The getElementsByClassName() and getElementsByTagName() methods return a live HTMLCollection.

* The querySelectorAll() method returns a static NodeList.

* The childNodes property returns a live NodeList. 




# What is the Difference Between textContents, innerText, and innerHtml?

* textContents is all text contained by an element and all its children that are for formatting purposes only.
* innerText returns all text contained by an element and all its child elements.
* innerHtml returns all text, including html tags, that is contained by an element.




# What is the DOM node?
In the context of the DOM, a node is a single point in the node tree. Various things that are nodes are the document itself, elements, text, and comments.
