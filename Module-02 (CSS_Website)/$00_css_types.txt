
#--> CSS - means Cascading Style Sheet.

Cascading means when we command sometimes more then one times then final term/command will be work.
Example : 
            h1{
                color : red;
                text-align : right;
                margin : 10px;
                padding : 5px;
            }
            h1{
                color : blue;
                text-align : left;
                margin : 5px;
                padding : 5px;
            }
            h1{
                color : cyan;
                text-align : canter;
                margin : 10px;
                padding : 10px;
            }

            now the last or third term/command will be work.

           3)External CSS - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file


#--> CSS SELECTORS - CSS selectors are used to select the content you want to style. Selectors are the part of CSS rule set. CSS selectors select HTML elements according to its id, class, type, attribute etc.

       There are several different types of selectors in CSS.

            CSS Element Selector - The element selector selects the HTML element by name.

                                   Example - p{  
                                                 text-align: center;  
                                                color: blue;  
                                              }   

                                            <p>This style will be applied on every paragraph.</p>
                        

            CSS Id Selector - The id selector selects the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific
                              element.An id is always unique within the page so it is chosen to select a single, unique element.
                              It is written with the hash character (#), followed by the id of the element.

                              Example - #para1 {  
                                                text-align: center;  
                                                 color: blue;  
                                               }  

                                               <p id="para1">Hello Javatpoint.com</p>  

            CSS Class Selector - The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. It is 
                                 used with a period character . (full stop symbol) followed by the class name.

                              Example - 
                                          .center {  
                                                     text-align: center;  
                                                     color: blue;  
                                                   }  

                                                   <h1 class="center">This heading is blue and center-aligned.</h1>  
                                                   <p class="center">This paragraph is blue and center-aligned.</p>



                                CSS Class Selector for specific element:

                                If you want to specify that only one specific HTML element should be affected then you should use the element name with class selector.

                                example - 

                                p.center {  
                                            text-align: center;  
                                            color: blue;  
                                         }  

                                    <h1 class="center">This heading is not affected</h1>  
                                    <p class="center">This paragraph is blue and center-aligned.</p>   


  
            CSS Universal Selector - The universal selector is used as a wildcard character. It selects all the  
                                     elements on the pages.

                                Example -

                                     * {  
                                        color: green;  
                                        font-size: 20px;  

                                      }
   

            CSS Group Selector - The grouping selector is used to select all the elements with the same style definitions.
                                 Grouping selector is used to minimize the code. Commas are used to separate each selector in grouping.    

                        Example - h1,h2,p {  
                                             text-align: center;  
                                             color: blue;
                                          }
